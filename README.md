Chip and Compiler in Ruby based on [Elements of Computing Systems by Nisan and Schocken](http://www.idc.ac.il/tecs/).

I used Ruby for the assembler, which I haven't confirmed, may be a bit unique. Otherwise, the chips and test files are done in the same language as the book describes. The test files of the assembler, I believe only have the final test, as I ran through them sequentially using on the "test.vm" file to keep things easy for my command line typing.
